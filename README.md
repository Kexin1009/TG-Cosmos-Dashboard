# Tigergraph + CosmoGraph Dashboard
A dashboard for visualizing Tigergraph data using CosmoGraph
## Cosmos
Cosmos is a WebGL Force Graph layout algorithm and rendering engine. All the computations and drawing are happening on the GPU in fragment and vertex shaders avoiding expensive memory operations.
It enables real-time simulation of network graphs consisting of hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges on modern hardware.
